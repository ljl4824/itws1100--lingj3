                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>My programing story begining in the first year I came to rpi. Priou to this, most of the time I used computer is to play video game. This sounds a bit ridiculous, but this is the fact. And when I encountered machine problem, I had no idea to fix it in a short time because I didn't have any basic of coding and knowledge of fixxing problem. Unless my programmer father is by my side. I want to get rid of this situation and then I select the major of Computer Science.</p>
